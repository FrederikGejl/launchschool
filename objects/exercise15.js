//Identify all of the variables, object property names, primitive values, and objects in the following code. 
//This problem is even more challenging than the previous one.

//variables: bar, foo, qux, arg1, arg 2
//primitive: hello, null,
//object property names:
//objects: 

function bar(arg1, arg2) {
  let foo = 'Hello';
  const qux = {
    abc: [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6]],
    def: null,
    ghi: NaN,
    jkl: foo,
    mno: arg1,
    pqr: arg2,
  };

  return qux;
}

let result = bar('Victor', 'Antonina');



Solution
Variables: bar, arg1, arg2, foo, qux, and result.

Property Names: abc, def, ghi, jkl, mno, pqr, 0, 1, 2, and 3. Don't forget that array indexes are property names.

Primitive values: 'Hello', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, null, NaN, 'Victor', and 'Antonina' are the most apparent primitive values. Since property names are strings in most cases, and strings are primitive values, we should also include 'abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl'. 'mno', 'pqr', '0', '1', '2', and '3'.

Objects: The bar function, the array [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6]], the array [4, 5, 6], and the object assigned to qux on line 3 are all objects.
